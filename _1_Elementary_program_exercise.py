def monthly_emi_amortization():
    '''
    (8)   Formula to calculate Monthly installment on a Loan.

    Monthly Payment = P (r(1+r)^n)/((1+r)^n-1).
    
    r: Interest rate. This is the monthly interest rate associated with the loan. 
        Your annual interest rate (usually called an APR or annual percentage rate) is listed 
        in the loan documents. To get the monthly interest rate that you need, simply divide 
        the annual interest rate by 12.
        For example, an 8% annual interest rate would be divided by 12 to get a monthly 
        interest rate of 0.67%. This would then be expressed as a decimal for the equation 
        by dividing it by 100 as follows: 0.67/100=0.0067. So 0.0067 will be the monthly 
        interest rate used in these calculations.
    
    n: Number of Payments. This is the total number of payments made over the life of the loan. 
        For example, in a three year loan paid monthly n = 3 x 12 = 36.

    P: Principal. The amount of the loan is called the principal. 
        This is typically the final price after tax of the asset purchased less any down payment
